>* Second, you can repeat the steps of **Example 2** until you reached the content you want.

## Questions   
1. What's the difference between **Page** and **Title**?   
   Well,**Page** is specially modified to cater the page turning function, which will automatically parse the url of the button and form the right url of the next page.

2. Where can I find the output file?   
   Just click the "setting" icon on the top-left corner, and you can see the folder you are using(and click the "open folder" button to open it)
